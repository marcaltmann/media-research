00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.129
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.330
Welcome to China News.

3
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.009
I'm Zizhuo.

4
00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:08.292
A woman from Hong Kong used three months to go deep into the 14 once poor areas of the mainland.

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:13.875
Climbing the stairs, taking a walk, from the rain to the desert, she showed the world the real face of China's poverty.

6
00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:27.181
She is Hong Kong TVB host Cheng Bei'er, who touched China in the year 2021.

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.701
Today, we are honored to have Mr. Bei'er to tell us the story behind the story of the treasured documentary, The Endless Road.

8
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:35.182
Now we see Mr. Bei'er is online.

9
00:00:35.203 --> 00:00:36.423
Hello, Mr. Bei'er.

10
00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.664
Hello, welcome to Zouke Center.

11
00:00:38.683 --> 00:00:40.723
Say hello to our netizens in Mandarin.

12
00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:51.658
Okay, okay.

13
00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:53.158
Hello everyone, I'm Chen Fei Er.

14
00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.299
Hello everyone, I'm Chen Gu Yi.

15
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.101
I'm very happy to be able to chat with you here.

16
00:00:57.142 --> 00:00:58.241
Hello, Zizuo.

17
00:00:58.281 --> 00:00:59.423
Hello, hello, Fei Er.

18
00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:00.103
Welcome, Gu Yi.

19
00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:10.784
Welcome, Belle.

20
00:01:10.864 --> 00:01:15.888
As we all know, Belle came to Beijing not long ago to participate in the Chinese Film Awards.

21
00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:18.209
She was also the best female host of TVB in Hong Kong.

22
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.430
How do you see yourself in Hong Kong and the mainland?

23
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.414
I am very grateful to the audience and netizens for their support of our program.

24
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.694
I think I'm very lucky to have the opportunity to shoot this program.

25
00:01:42.754 --> 00:01:44.936
For me, this program is not just a program.

26
00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:50.902
During the three months, we went to six provinces and more than ten areas that were extremely poor.

27
00:02:01.302 --> 00:02:11.788
Because I grew up in the city, so before I went back to the mainland to shoot the documentary, my concept of the countryside was actually very vague.

28
00:02:11.807 --> 00:02:14.848
So during these three months, it was a very precious moment in my life.

29
00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.710
I was learning every day during the shoot.

30
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.473
So I think after shooting this show for three months, the day of the funeral, I was already very satisfied.

31
00:02:30.197 --> 00:02:35.581
When I first started filming, the whole team was very united, and we went through a lot of difficulties.

32
00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:39.586
But after we finished filming, I think we learned a lot during this process.

33
00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:41.106
So we are very satisfied.

34
00:02:41.146 --> 00:02:44.210
After that, our show was broadcast and received everyone's support.

35
00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:54.025
Thank you very much.

36
00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:09.289
Thank you, Bel.

37
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.711
Thank you for bringing us such a wonderful and precious program.

38
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.491
We know that the beginning of the show is the highest score of the annual documentary.

39
00:03:16.532 --> 00:03:22.153
In the process of filming, you and your team did not expect that the result would be so much attention and love.

40
00:03:28.045 --> 00:03:30.447
Wow, we really didn't think about it at all.

41
00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:36.250
Because I myself, when I do a show, my original intention is to be able to do my job well with all my heart.

42
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.973
And then I think as a media person, I want to pass on the real situation to my audience through our camera.

43
00:03:41.992 --> 00:03:43.834
That was originally my division.

44
00:03:43.873 --> 00:03:45.875
So I think I worked hard and our team worked hard.

45
00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:59.282
In fact, during this process, we have already We felt very satisfied.

46
00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:02.282
We felt that the support from the audience was an extra, a bonus, a surprise for us.

47
00:04:09.962 --> 00:04:12.825
So before filming this show, I really didn't know what the effect would be like.

48
00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:20.413
Instead, I focused on whether I was in a good state at every moment when I was filming the show, and whether I needed to invest in it.

49
00:04:20.432 --> 00:04:22.735
This is the most important thing for me to do when filming a show.

50
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.516
We know that after this program was broadcast, it received a lot of good reviews in mainland China and Hong Kong.

51
00:04:36.536 --> 00:04:41.781
Belle, after this program was broadcast in Hong Kong, what kind of reflections did Hong Kong audiences usually have?

52
00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:43.324
Have you communicated with them?

53
00:04:49.428 --> 00:04:53.973
Every time the program is broadcast, my social media platforms, the audience will be very eager to leave me comments.

54
00:04:54.553 --> 00:04:55.415
I read every comment.

55
00:04:55.435 --> 00:05:04.163
So I am very grateful that after they saw the program, they gave me comments that they think through this program, they can now understand more about the development of our country.

56
00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:16.314
We also know how the results of our Toping space can be implemented in every village.

57
00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:19.016
They can really improve the actual situation of their lives.

58
00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:19.778
They are all very touched.

59
00:05:19.798 --> 00:05:23.380
And for the content of our program, they will also be very curious.

60
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.562
I think it's very interesting.

61
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.872
Our viewers in Hong Kong feel that the country is developing so well and so fast.

62
00:05:36.913 --> 00:05:38.153
I encourage them to watch the show.

63
00:05:38.173 --> 00:05:43.943
If they feel that the show is welcoming, touching, or curious, I encourage them to take the time to go back to their home country,

64
00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:49.180
to feel and experience it, to go to each of our places, and to communicate with the villagers, and to chat with them.

65
00:06:03.668 --> 00:06:04.310
What do they eat now?

66
00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:05.451
What do they do with their friends?

67
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:07.774
I am very encouraged by this personal experience.

68
00:06:07.814 --> 00:06:10.976
I think this endless journey is to rely on everyone to walk out on their own.

69
00:06:10.997 --> 00:06:11.978
So I am also very happy.

70
00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:15.603
The reactions from my friends in Hong Kong are also very sincere, especially in Hong Kong.

71
00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:31.088
We Hongkongers actually love to eat, so our show, for example, introduces Yunnan's coffee, Hainan's organic tea, or Rong'an's Jingju,

72
00:06:31.088 --> 00:06:31.889
and so on.

73
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.273
Wow, the reactions are all very glorious.

74
00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:39.858
They are all asking me, Where can they buy and support those agricultural products?

75
00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:43.382
I think through this program, I can also introduce it to my audience in Hong Kong.

76
00:06:43.442 --> 00:06:46.964
I know that China's agricultural industry is also developing very well.

77
00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:48.607
Everyone can support more.

78
00:06:48.627 --> 00:06:50.548
You can also buy through consumption.

79
00:06:50.567 --> 00:06:52.389
You can also support our villagers.

80
00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:54.072
I think this is also very interesting.

81
00:07:00.302 --> 00:07:05.605
In fact, when I was in December last year, it was the first time I was in touch with the gathering of the Endless Road.

82
00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.466
I was very shocked after watching the two episodes.

83
00:07:07.485 --> 00:07:14.363
After I watched it, I immediately read the comments, including those of us in the mainland, those of us in the Hong Kong and Macao regions,

84
00:07:14.363 --> 00:07:15.649
and those of us overseas.

85
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:21.473
I found that many of the audience were talking about this issue, and they all said one word, which is sincerity.

86
00:07:21.694 --> 00:07:25.415
Then again, do you think sincerity is the password to the success of the Endless Road?

87
00:07:27.303 --> 00:07:31.874
Do you think it's a successful password?

88
00:07:31.913 --> 00:07:41.593
I think our program really keeps the original intention, which is to make the most authentic, are presented to the audience through our camera.

89
00:07:41.754 --> 00:07:47.937
I saw a lot of viewers saying that this program is very down-to-earth, very sincere, and so on.

90
00:07:47.956 --> 00:07:51.298
I think our program is actually growing from small to large.

91
00:07:51.317 --> 00:08:01.483
We go to every point, every region that has been extremely poor, to interview those representatives, and then from their stories,

92
00:08:01.483 --> 00:08:06.684
their little stories, to create a blueprint for a better society.

93
00:08:06.704 --> 00:08:12.706
So I think the audience will be moved to see that the lives of the villagers and the people are already very happy and confident.

94
00:08:19.564 --> 00:08:20.605
They are very satisfied.

95
00:08:20.865 --> 00:08:23.526
They are happy to see the improvement of the lives of the villagers.

96
00:08:23.547 --> 00:08:24.627
They are also touched by this.

97
00:08:24.668 --> 00:08:29.550
I was also touched by this when I was filming the program.

98
00:08:29.771 --> 00:08:32.452
I think our program can move people because I was the first one to be touched.

99
00:08:40.884 --> 00:08:46.346
First of all, you were moved by yourself, and then you were able to bring your emotions to everyone.

100
00:08:46.365 --> 00:08:50.486
So I think that Invincible can be successful for many other reasons besides sincerity.

101
00:08:50.506 --> 00:08:53.907
How would you rate the success of this documentary?

102
00:08:54.006 --> 00:09:01.028
I think we should make our programs with our hearts.

103
00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:03.629
I think that people should rely on their sincere hearts.

104
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.493
When I was shooting the show, I didn't think of it as just a job.

105
00:09:11.552 --> 00:09:12.673
I went to every point.

106
00:09:12.714 --> 00:09:19.397
Every friend that we arranged to meet, I really wanted to make friends with them, to get to know their lives, to complete the show.

107
00:09:19.417 --> 00:09:21.236
It's not just a job.

108
00:09:21.398 --> 00:09:22.498
I think it's more of a mission.

109
00:09:34.364 --> 00:09:36.384
And it's also an opportunity for me to learn by myself.

110
00:09:36.404 --> 00:09:38.826
So, what do you call it, a password for success?

111
00:09:38.846 --> 00:09:48.431
I think I really didn't have a very, how to say it, a very planned way to get to a point, to do something, to say something to move people.

112
00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:52.253
In fact, it's all out of a very sincere, very natural instinct, a nature.

113
00:09:59.096 --> 00:10:02.557
So I think it should be the most sincere way to treat others.

114
00:10:02.577 --> 00:10:03.118
Well said.

115
00:10:03.138 --> 00:10:06.539
Speaking of which, I've always been very curious about the name of the book.

116
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.780
Because I think many people have read it.

117
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.302
It's a book about one and the same thing.

118
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:13.102
I've heard a lot of people's interpretations.

119
00:10:13.202 --> 00:10:14.423
I don't know how you interpret it.

120
00:10:14.464 --> 00:10:16.884
Can you share with us the process of the creation of this name?

121
00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.831
I think the name Wuchong Road is really interesting.

122
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:32.251
It was chosen by Mr. Yuan from our news department.

123
00:10:32.272 --> 00:10:36.214
Of course, Wuchong Road means that there is no poverty, because there is no poverty.

124
00:10:36.254 --> 00:10:38.153
And there is also a deeper interpretation.

125
00:10:38.173 --> 00:10:43.696
I think that after the people are poor, we are also on the way to a better and happier life.

126
00:10:43.716 --> 00:10:46.697
This is also a Wuchong Road that everyone should work hard on.

127
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.801
So on this road, we all have to work harder and be united to go on together.

128
00:10:59.821 --> 00:11:03.422
So we are also planning to shoot a sister-brother film.

129
00:11:03.522 --> 00:11:09.602
In fact, on this road, I think there are really too many stories about our China that are worth shooting and should be shot.

130
00:11:09.623 --> 00:11:11.043
So this is also a way of learning.

131
00:11:11.062 --> 00:11:12.443
For me, it is also a way of learning.

132
00:11:24.673 --> 00:11:30.998
I also hope that we can continue to do this as a bridge, to talk about our Chinese story with all our heart.

133
00:11:31.077 --> 00:11:34.039
I also hope that everyone can follow me on this road of no end.

134
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:44.307
It seems that it is not only the road of Tuoping Palace, but also more of our TV people, media people, and then the story of everyone playing cards to go on this relatively long road.

135
00:11:53.222 --> 00:11:59.013
Fei'er, we know that there are only five people in your original project, so you have to go to so many places in these three months.

136
00:11:59.173 --> 00:12:02.578
In fact, you must have done a lot of work in the early stages.

137
00:12:06.243 --> 00:12:09.543
Yes, our crew consists of five people.

138
00:12:09.825 --> 00:12:17.488
Our TVB in Hong Kong sent four people, including me, Chen Ying, Benson, and two other photographers.

139
00:12:17.508 --> 00:12:20.528
Four of them came back to China from Hong Kong.

140
00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:23.529
One of them is a girl from Guangzhou.

141
00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:31.455
She is in charge of I think it's really difficult because five people in a team, not many people.

142
00:12:47.796 --> 00:12:50.937
The best part is that we are determined to complete this program.

143
00:12:50.998 --> 00:12:51.398
It's very powerful.

144
00:12:51.418 --> 00:12:57.701
I remember every time we arrived at a certain point, because there were only five of us, we would pick up our cameras and take pictures of what we saw.

145
00:13:08.869 --> 00:13:13.192
Although there are two camera men, all five of us are photographers.

146
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:15.994
We see what we need to shoot, and we will shoot.

147
00:13:16.374 --> 00:13:23.428
If we reach a certain point, and we think that the person is worth interviewing, and we want to know more about them, we will chat with them,

148
00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:25.480
talk to them, and communicate with them.

149
00:13:29.113 --> 00:13:33.296
So even though five of us didn't have much work to do, we did what we had to do.

150
00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:37.298
Even though there were only five of us, we had five cameras and five reporters.

151
00:13:37.318 --> 00:13:38.460
So that was very powerful.

152
00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:43.283
I'm very grateful to be able to be part of such a great team.

153
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.543
Because three months is actually very difficult and very tiring.

154
00:13:58.643 --> 00:13:59.524
Yes, there are so many places.

155
00:13:59.543 --> 00:14:03.946
But we really support each other, and we really encourage each other in this journey.

156
00:14:04.046 --> 00:14:06.226
It is a family of life and death.

157
00:14:06.528 --> 00:14:12.490
We have also experienced a lot of difficulties, but we can overcome them one by one.

158
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.764
I also want to know how you choose the right place and the right person in advance.

159
00:14:29.219 --> 00:14:30.359
Yes, of course.

160
00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:37.140
Before we started this program, we had a plan of where we would go, and which people we would interview.

161
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.201
That was a very detailed plan.

162
00:14:38.241 --> 00:14:41.763
Because our space for peace is precisely for poverty alleviation.

163
00:14:41.883 --> 00:14:45.644
Our country is so big, there are so many places, and there are different regions.

164
00:14:54.451 --> 00:14:59.773
They need to be flat, but the reason for the flatness is different.

165
00:14:59.793 --> 00:15:01.553
So the precise flatness is aimed at the place.

166
00:15:01.573 --> 00:15:05.855
They found a plan to cooperate with the place for the poor.

167
00:15:05.875 --> 00:15:08.336
So the so-called precise flatness.

168
00:15:08.557 --> 00:15:12.399
For example, the cliff village is a very typical example of a flat.

169
00:15:12.438 --> 00:15:22.187
They used to live at such a high It takes more than 2,000 units to get to that area, so it must be done through the Topee,

170
00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:28.341
the ED class, to move them down and set them up in a very well-matched room.

171
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.581
And then there is, for example, the tourist welfare.

172
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.721
The most classic example of tourist welfare, of course, is Li Tang.

173
00:15:35.761 --> 00:15:37.883
There is a net celebrity, Ding Zhen.

174
00:15:37.942 --> 00:15:41.844
His exposure can also be said to have reddened the whole Li Tang.

175
00:15:42.183 --> 00:15:43.783
And then it's also because of tourism.

176
00:15:51.277 --> 00:15:56.299
To drive the economy, so that the places of the litany can be flattened.

177
00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:04.420
Then there are also different solutions, such as industrial poverty alleviation, education poverty alleviation, infrastructure,

178
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.248
that is, building bridges, and so on, to flatten the place.

179
00:16:08.288 --> 00:16:15.552
For example, in Nujang, the place where people used to cross the river, it was only through a dangerous loop.

180
00:16:15.653 --> 00:16:19.836
And now the government has also built more than 100 bridges to connect the two sides.

181
00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:26.769
So this is also one of the in terms of transportation.

182
00:16:26.788 --> 00:16:29.529
So when we say we choose a place, there are actually four elements to choose from.

183
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:38.197
We have to choose a specific and representative place, and we have to present a different plan for the space to be flattened,

184
00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:41.572
and a precise flattening method to the audience.

185
00:16:41.851 --> 00:16:46.913
It is for this reason that we chose different places and different representatives in our 12 episodes.

186
00:16:52.489 --> 00:16:52.950
That's very good.

187
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:56.991
I'm actually more curious about the cliff village in Sichuan-Zhaojue County.

188
00:16:57.032 --> 00:17:00.673
At that time, the first level was climbing more than 5,000 steps.

189
00:17:00.712 --> 00:17:01.734
It took more than 10 hours.

190
00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:03.695
It was actually very, very hard work.

191
00:17:03.715 --> 00:17:06.016
I want to know why you had to climb it yourself.

192
00:17:06.036 --> 00:17:07.957
Because it must have consumed a lot of energy for you, right?

193
00:17:20.394 --> 00:17:21.776
Yes, it's very tiring.

194
00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:24.058
There are so many things to do.

195
00:17:24.479 --> 00:17:27.462
And we grew up in the city.

196
00:17:27.542 --> 00:17:32.108
If I had to climb more than a dozen stairs, I would probably be a little angry, right?

197
00:17:36.068 --> 00:17:39.491
But that day, our design team didn't really give me any pressure.

198
00:17:39.511 --> 00:17:40.392
They said, just do your best.

199
00:17:40.412 --> 00:17:45.215
Because if you really can't get to the top, there are other ways to tell the story.

200
00:17:45.236 --> 00:17:48.097
But I think I'm asking myself to have this personal experience.

201
00:17:56.257 --> 00:18:02.644
Because I think I have really climbed up every level like this, I can deeply experience and experience those villagers.

202
00:18:02.663 --> 00:18:06.528
They have been living on the cliff village for generations.

203
00:18:06.548 --> 00:18:13.134
Under their mentality, How do they feel?

204
00:18:13.454 --> 00:18:18.219
And when we finished shooting, we went to their new studio the next day.

205
00:18:18.239 --> 00:18:22.162
Then I could really feel their heart from despair to the feeling of full of hope.

206
00:18:22.182 --> 00:18:23.442
I have only experienced it myself.

207
00:18:23.481 --> 00:18:26.984
I can do it in front of my camera, in front of my audience.

208
00:18:32.574 --> 00:18:33.413
To tell the story to them.

209
00:18:33.433 --> 00:18:35.075
It was very, very hard to climb the downhill.

210
00:18:35.736 --> 00:18:39.357
I felt a little dizzy when I climbed halfway.

211
00:18:39.377 --> 00:18:40.998
But I really admire our villagers.

212
00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:47.582
I think they have been running like this every day, and I am just a passer-by in front of them.

213
00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:02.559
I don't have a reason to complain about my hard work in front of them.

214
00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:08.784
So I'm really grateful to the Muslims and non-Muslims who accompanied me and encouraged me during the filming process.

215
00:19:08.804 --> 00:19:11.226
I'm very grateful to have their support and encouragement.

216
00:19:11.346 --> 00:19:18.891
And it's because I personally experienced their hard work that I really feel that their happiness now is not easy.

217
00:19:27.256 --> 00:19:28.576
I was very happy for him.

218
00:19:28.616 --> 00:19:34.338
Well, in fact, you've been to so many places all the way to see different scenery and visit different people.

219
00:19:34.358 --> 00:19:38.441
So in your opinion, which character do you think brought you this feeling or shock?

220
00:19:38.461 --> 00:19:39.281
Wow, actually every point.

221
00:19:47.105 --> 00:19:50.426
Actually, they all have different memories and views.

222
00:19:50.547 --> 00:20:00.270
I think every point, every person we interviewed, they all represent a different personality of Chinese people.

223
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.893
For example, in Xuan Ya Village, we interviewed a certain woman.

224
00:20:03.932 --> 00:20:12.179
She was not afraid of hardship, the spirit of not giving up.

225
00:20:12.219 --> 00:20:13.619
They are the villagers of our village.

226
00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.323
They are living in such a difficult environment, but they can hold on to it.

227
00:20:18.363 --> 00:20:19.964
They can overcome it.

228
00:20:19.984 --> 00:20:23.186
So I think it's really amazing.

229
00:20:23.287 --> 00:20:24.887
And then we went to Lujang.

230
00:20:24.988 --> 00:20:26.788
In Lujang, we also interviewed Dr. Liu Suo.

231
00:20:37.204 --> 00:20:41.027
He also represents the commitment to respect the commitment.

232
00:20:41.067 --> 00:20:45.269
This kind of precious mentality also makes me want to bow to him.

233
00:20:45.368 --> 00:20:48.029
It also made me feel very touched.

234
00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:50.290
Then we went to the auditorium and saw Ding Zhen.

235
00:20:50.671 --> 00:20:52.991
There are also a lot of young people over there.

236
00:20:53.011 --> 00:20:57.473
They are all very amazing and very mission-oriented.

237
00:20:57.493 --> 00:21:00.215
They are also the current internet celebrities of Zhihua County.

238
00:21:06.137 --> 00:21:09.200
Can send short videos through the Internet, etc.

239
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.383
I think this is also a great sense of mission for young people in China.

240
00:21:12.403 --> 00:21:17.546
So I think at every point, I can see that different people, Chinese people, are acting out their great personalities.

241
00:21:17.586 --> 00:21:19.307
So it makes me feel very, very touched.

242
00:21:31.603 --> 00:21:35.164
You mentioned a lot of characters, and I noticed one of them.

243
00:21:35.184 --> 00:21:38.846
She was a woman from Yunnan who planted coffee and raised women.

244
00:21:38.886 --> 00:21:42.128
Her name was Ye Ping, and I think you remember her.

245
00:21:42.209 --> 00:21:47.132
I remember when I was reading the film, I found out that you mentioned this person and said that she was a Geng Ye.

246
00:21:47.252 --> 00:21:49.253
Can you recall what happened at that time?

247
00:21:49.273 --> 00:21:50.273
What kind of point touched you?

248
00:21:56.528 --> 00:21:59.588
Yes, you just asked me which character touched me the most.

249
00:21:59.689 --> 00:22:01.449
Actually, I really think it's hard to choose.

250
00:22:01.489 --> 00:22:05.529
I just mentioned three of them, and the one you just mentioned, Ye-Ping, is also very admirable.

251
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:29.064
A woman can take on a responsibility, a mission, and in addition to doing it for herself, In addition, the whole village was also flattened because he started to grow coffee.

252
00:22:29.124 --> 00:22:37.048
He told me that in the past, the ethnic minorities in their village did not have a high position, and even had to share tables with men to eat.

253
00:22:37.068 --> 00:22:41.951
But later, he was very confident in himself and was very confident in his ability.

254
00:22:47.935 --> 00:22:53.280
So she thought that everyone could try to make coffee to help with poverty alleviation.

255
00:22:53.320 --> 00:23:01.067
So I think as a woman, she really taught me to believe in myself and not to underestimate my ability.

256
00:23:01.429 --> 00:23:03.069
Women are the strongest.

257
00:23:03.089 --> 00:23:04.050
Yes, I noticed that too.

258
00:23:12.173 --> 00:23:12.933
Very impressive.

259
00:23:12.953 --> 00:23:14.894
That day, he gave me a cup of his coffee.

260
00:23:14.954 --> 00:23:16.276
I drank it in my mouth.

261
00:23:16.336 --> 00:23:18.518
I still remember the feeling of warmth in my heart.

262
00:23:18.538 --> 00:23:21.400
That cup of coffee actually represents his coffee life.

263
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:34.064
When you drink it in your mouth, it may be a little bitter at first, but the taste, the taste of the liver, the taste of the liver,

264
00:23:34.064 --> 00:23:43.813
the taste of the liver, shì luǎn zài xīn tóu de nèi bēi kā fēi, The story is so moving and touching.

265
00:23:43.972 --> 00:23:46.675
It's a story of hard times and sweet times.

266
00:23:46.816 --> 00:23:50.999
Yes, it's a story of hard times and sweet times.

267
00:23:51.079 --> 00:23:54.041
I saw that you recently posted a post on Weibo.

268
00:23:54.102 --> 00:23:56.284
It's a report from the Chinese Women's Daily.

269
00:23:56.344 --> 00:24:00.106
It reports that Guizhou has been guarding 13 villages for 36 years.

270
00:24:00.247 --> 00:24:02.009
It's a village girl named Luo Haixiang.

271
00:24:02.028 --> 00:24:04.770
I want to ask if you like to pay attention to women's topics.

272
00:24:11.587 --> 00:24:12.388
Yes, of course.

273
00:24:12.469 --> 00:24:16.329
I think women should not underestimate their power.

274
00:24:16.351 --> 00:24:17.891
I think women are very powerful.

275
00:24:17.911 --> 00:24:23.913
We are in different positions, even if you are a normal woman working, or you need to take care of your family.

276
00:24:23.933 --> 00:24:27.336
Actually, taking care of the family is also very great.

277
00:24:27.355 --> 00:24:36.580
So I think we are in different positions, as long as we are determined, to use their own abilities, they will shine and shine.

278
00:24:36.601 --> 00:24:37.721
They are the best female protagonists in everyone's mind.

279
00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.141

280
00:24:38.161 --> 00:24:38.561

00:24:59.320 --> 00:24:59.540
Um, um.

330
00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:19.943
At that time, we went to Li Tang, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level.

331
00:25:19.983 --> 00:25:24.707
In fact, our design team also prepared a good schedule for us for Li Tang.

332
00:25:24.747 --> 00:25:29.189
Before that, they thought it would be better not to waste time.

333
00:25:29.209 --> 00:25:32.849
Because the shooting time is also very short.

334
00:25:32.869 --> 00:25:35.270
So we can just take the plane directly.

335
00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:47.834
But because we In order to slowly adapt to the high altitude, I had to take the car to pass one by one.

336
00:25:47.854 --> 00:25:51.055
But then I also had the reaction of the mountain.

337
00:25:51.315 --> 00:25:55.296
At that time, my head was very, very painful.

338
00:25:55.455 --> 00:25:57.297
It had never been so painful before.

339
00:25:57.336 --> 00:25:58.257
And my heart was stinging.

340
00:25:58.376 --> 00:26:00.998
It was like there was a big stone pressing my heart.

341
00:26:29.096 --> 00:26:32.020
So they helped me to go to the hospital.

342
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:32.842
I took a day off.

343
00:26:32.862 --> 00:26:35.124
I can get used to it the next day.

344
00:26:35.144 --> 00:26:50.939
They said that my body If you are really interested, you can go to the auditorium.

345
00:26:51.098 --> 00:26:55.540
As long as you get the right treatment, don't be afraid to have a high-risk reaction.

346
00:27:10.467 --> 00:27:13.069
I also remember what you said when you talked about this experience.

347
00:27:13.089 --> 00:27:15.551
You said you wanted to appreciate the scenery and face the difficulties.

348
00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:17.394
What do you think of the scenery of the auditorium?

349
00:27:17.413 --> 00:27:19.997
How did you feel when you were shooting in the auditorium?

350
00:27:30.722 --> 00:27:32.703
The scenery in Litang is very, very beautiful.

351
00:27:32.804 --> 00:27:38.406
I remember very well that this is the last stop of our three-month filming journey.

352
00:27:38.547 --> 00:27:42.327
In fact, after more than two months of filming, my body is already very tired.

353
00:27:42.628 --> 00:27:47.270
But after going to Litang, you will feel that the whole person, the whole mood seems to be able to relax suddenly.

354
00:27:57.167 --> 00:28:02.112
I also think that people will appreciate the scenery and the people there.

355
00:28:02.132 --> 00:28:05.255
They will also give you a feeling of comfort, even with a serious smile.

356
00:28:05.535 --> 00:28:09.858
Yes, everyone thinks that a serious smile is really comforting.

357
00:28:09.878 --> 00:28:11.720
I think that place has a very mysterious power for me.

358
00:28:20.406 --> 00:28:21.468
I still remember it very well.

359
00:28:21.488 --> 00:28:28.053
In addition to Ding Zheng, the people of Li Tang, and the young people of Malaya, I can really feel from their faces how pure they are about the world.

360
00:28:28.093 --> 00:28:29.213
I still remember it very well.

361
00:28:29.233 --> 00:28:31.236
I still hope that there will be a chance to bring it back.

362
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.851
We know that Belle has been living in a prosperous city.

363
00:28:45.871 --> 00:28:48.751
She was born in Hong Kong and went to Canada to study.

364
00:28:48.771 --> 00:28:51.373
You may not have had a profound experience of poverty.

365
00:28:51.413 --> 00:28:54.574
Why did you come to the mainland to shoot a program about poverty alleviation?

366
00:28:54.594 --> 00:28:59.536
I think this program is a rare opportunity for me.

367
00:28:59.816 --> 00:29:05.518
Our TVB managers often have the opportunity to go back to China for communication.

368
00:29:05.557 --> 00:29:07.038
Mr. Yuan Ziwei, Ms. Huang Shuming, etc.

369
00:29:12.898 --> 00:29:19.267
They actually went back to their home country, and after the exchange, they went back to Hong Kong.

370
00:29:19.287 --> 00:29:23.632
They felt that they had to make a show to let Hong Kong viewers and overseas viewers know about the development of the country.

371
00:29:23.672 --> 00:29:27.396
Last year, the country announced that the free space was a complete victory.

372
00:29:31.855 --> 00:29:38.359
And it's also much earlier than the United Nations Sustainable Development Plan, which can be completed in 10 years.

373
00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.801
So I think it's a very, very great thing.

374
00:29:39.821 --> 00:29:40.642
And how can it be done?

375
00:29:40.662 --> 00:29:41.083
Why can it be done?

376
00:29:41.123 --> 00:29:43.505
I think a lot of people have this question.

377
00:30:09.827 --> 00:30:11.829
We hope to let everyone know through this program.

378
00:30:11.849 --> 00:30:14.411
So we also made a special version in English.

379
00:30:14.451 --> 00:30:18.815
We hope to let the audience in and out of the sea know about the development of our country.

380
00:30:19.015 --> 00:30:23.597
Well, in fact, Belle is now shooting the second part of The Endless Road.

381
00:30:23.698 --> 00:30:24.699
It should be shot soon.

382
00:30:24.798 --> 00:30:28.221
I want to know, do you think the first part has achieved such a good result?

383
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.982
Will there be pressure in the second part?

384
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:42.826
I am looking forward to it, but I am also under a lot of pressure.

385
00:30:42.846 --> 00:30:50.115
Because our Brothers and Sisters 2 will actually go to more places than the second episode.

386
00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:56.487
It's also something I've never been to before.

387
00:30:56.507 --> 00:30:58.910
So I think for me, it's also a very good learning process.

388
00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:00.230
It can also make me more open-minded.

389
00:31:00.351 --> 00:31:03.374
I'm really getting ready now, because it's going to start soon.

390
00:31:03.394 --> 00:31:04.434
It's going to start in April.

391
00:31:04.454 --> 00:31:06.717
So I'm very excited right now.

392
00:31:06.797 --> 00:31:07.537
I think it's going to be...

393
00:31:18.788 --> 00:31:21.712
It's also a journey that makes me look forward to.

394
00:31:21.772 --> 00:31:26.919
I sincerely invite everyone to join me on this wonderful journey.

395
00:31:27.058 --> 00:31:27.720
I can't wait.

396
00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:28.421
I can't wait.

397
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.442
I can't wait.

398
00:31:29.461 --> 00:31:34.268
I hope I can share what I've seen and heard with everyone.

399
00:31:38.423 --> 00:31:41.346
We are also looking forward to the second part, and we can't wait to watch it.

400
00:31:41.365 --> 00:31:45.308
We have put the focus on the film, and now we will focus on Belle.

401
00:31:45.328 --> 00:31:48.590
We know that Belle has been a successful host in Hong Kong before filming the film.

402
00:31:57.836 --> 00:31:58.957
I think I am very lucky.

403
00:31:58.977 --> 00:32:00.938
I have a lot of opportunities since I entered the industry.

404
00:32:25.755 --> 00:32:34.138
In the beginning, I had the opportunity to go to some international entertainment events such as the Oscars, Cannes Film Festival,

405
00:32:34.138 --> 00:32:35.364
Milan, Paris, etc.

406
00:32:35.384 --> 00:32:39.807
After joining TVB, I had a lot of opportunities to do some variety variety shows.

407
00:32:40.228 --> 00:32:43.131
And then I also shot the world-wide segment and went to all over the world.

408
00:32:51.933 --> 00:32:53.953
And last year, I just shot the show.

409
00:32:53.973 --> 00:32:56.335
I think I was really lucky to be able to see different things.

410
00:32:56.355 --> 00:32:57.835
I went all over the world to meet different friends.

411
00:32:57.855 --> 00:33:06.086
And I think, for me, all the way to the end, even though it seems different at the beginning, at the beginning, it was probably entertainment news,

412
00:33:06.086 --> 00:33:10.397
and then it was some variety shows, and then I got to the edge of the world.

413
00:33:34.355 --> 00:33:38.477
Through our own eyes, through our camera, we can bring the world to the audience.

414
00:33:38.517 --> 00:33:39.497
And I am very lucky.

415
00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:42.518
I think I have the opportunity to do this all the way.

416
00:33:42.577 --> 00:33:44.838
Until now, I have been keeping my curiosity about the world.

417
00:33:44.858 --> 00:33:49.260
So I said that we are going to start filming the second part of The Endless Road.

418
00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.622
I am also very looking forward to it.

419
00:33:51.682 --> 00:33:55.303
I hope I can bring more audience friends to see, understand and get to know more.

420
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.771
Beier, we've been following up on your recent updates on Weibo.

421
00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:06.953
Are there any plans to go somewhere in the mainland?

422
00:34:07.034 --> 00:34:10.117
I came back to the mainland at the end of last year.

423
00:34:10.137 --> 00:34:18.262
After the show, I came back to the mainland to promote the show and communicate with people.

424
00:34:18.282 --> 00:34:19.704
Now, I'm going to start filming the show.

425
00:34:30.052 --> 00:34:34.117
I was able to stay in the mainland for about 8 years after filming.

426
00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:48.519
I found this trip very interesting because during the 3 months I was filming Invincible, I went to some big cities.

427
00:34:48.561 --> 00:34:57.126
So for me, in this short year, I have a lot of opportunities to learn more about the development of our country in different cities and their people's lives.

428
00:34:57.226 --> 00:34:58.628
It's very precious.

429
00:34:58.708 --> 00:34:59.909
I went to Beijing this time.

430
00:35:00.009 --> 00:35:01.809
I've been to Beijing a few times.

431
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.311
I like it very much.

432
00:35:03.731 --> 00:35:05.833
Then Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen.

433
00:35:13.271 --> 00:35:15.572
In Changsha, Chengdu, and so on.

434
00:35:15.672 --> 00:35:19.253
I have made a lot of exchanges with my friends from there.

435
00:35:19.273 --> 00:35:26.255
So I know that now our country and young people like to see what they want to know.

436
00:35:26.275 --> 00:35:32.838
So I hope that in our future programs, we can send out what we should know and what is worth knowing.

437
00:35:41.802 --> 00:35:52.190
So I'm really grateful to have this opportunity to be a bridge, to shoot more shows that everyone likes to watch, that are moving and sensitive to everyone.

438
00:35:55.159 --> 00:35:59.440
We've also noticed that Bayer has recently done a series of films about the journey to the future.

439
00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:04.003
I've also seen that they've updated the musicals, and also the two episodes of Hongquan and Gongfu.

440
00:36:04.043 --> 00:36:04.842
What will they do next?

441
00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:08.864
Yes, we have plans to continue filming.

442
00:36:08.903 --> 00:36:10.364
We've been asking for everyone's time.

443
00:36:23.789 --> 00:36:29.072
Yes, so I hope to continue to film about the heritage of Guangzhou non-tourism culture.

444
00:36:29.132 --> 00:36:33.896
Because I am a recommender over there, so I hope to let everyone know more about Guangzhou's non-tourism projects.

445
00:36:33.936 --> 00:36:40.902
I also hope that this program is really not just about sightseeing in Guangdong and Guangzhou, but in different places.

446
00:37:14.184 --> 00:37:18.726
We are still in the process of making an appointment.

447
00:37:18.766 --> 00:37:21.367
We are still in the process of making an appointment.

448
00:37:21.387 --> 00:37:23.228
We are still in the process of making an appointment.

449
00:37:23.248 --> 00:37:26.110
We are still in the process of making an appointment.

450
00:37:26.449 --> 00:37:28.431
We are still in the process of making an appointment.

451
00:37:28.471 --> 00:37:30.751
We are still in the process of making an appointment.

452
00:37:30.771 --> 00:37:32.512
We are still in the process of making an appointment.

453
00:37:32.552 --> 00:37:38.175
We are still in the process of making an appointment.

454
00:37:41.021 --> 00:37:44.586
Cantonese, of course, is the language I spoke when I was young.

455
00:37:45.085 --> 00:37:46.887
And I haven't learned Mandarin very well yet.

456
00:37:46.927 --> 00:37:49.210
So I think language is a bridge for communication between people.

457
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:54.333
So if you need Cantonese, if you need Mandarin, I think it's very important to communicate.

458
00:37:54.353 --> 00:37:56.295
You need to communicate to understand more.

459
00:37:56.356 --> 00:37:59.478
So before filming the show, you were right about the Cantonese version.

460
00:38:13.173 --> 00:38:14.574
But I also want to learn Mandarin.

461
00:38:14.713 --> 00:38:19.554
I want to be able to communicate with my villagers in a familiar language.

462
00:38:19.594 --> 00:38:23.416
So whether the program is Mandarin or Mandarin, I think it's all welcome.

463
00:38:23.476 --> 00:38:25.036
I think it depends on the situation.

464
00:38:25.076 --> 00:38:27.737
I can communicate with my villagers in any way.

465
00:38:41.351 --> 00:38:41.431
Oh.

466
00:39:01.213 --> 00:39:03.894
After the show, many Hong Kong viewers left me comments.

467
00:39:03.914 --> 00:39:08.056
They were happy to learn more about the country's development through the show.

468
00:39:08.096 --> 00:39:10.976
They gave us and our team a lot of encouragement.

469
00:39:10.996 --> 00:39:12.556
They said they hoped we could continue filming.

470
00:39:12.577 --> 00:39:16.637
I also think that there are too many stories worth filming in China.

471
00:39:16.657 --> 00:39:17.398
So I think there are...

472
00:39:55.512 --> 00:40:02.614
In addition to talking about Hong Kong and Hong Kong-Au area, we also mentioned a hot topic called Big Bay area.

473
00:40:02.976 --> 00:40:07.378
Have you ever thought about shooting some special programs in the Big Bay area?

474
00:40:07.398 --> 00:40:08.677
Yes, you are very smart.

475
00:40:08.697 --> 00:40:11.599
I am already shooting.

476
00:40:11.619 --> 00:40:15.141
I have been busy shooting the second part of the show in April.

477
00:40:21.481 --> 00:40:28.184
Before I joined the group, I was actually filming other shows, such as The Journey to the City, and another one was filmed in the Bay Area.

478
00:40:28.204 --> 00:40:28.965
I was also busy.

479
00:40:28.985 --> 00:40:34.668
I think, yes, the 25th anniversary of the return of Hong Kong to China is a very special day.

480
00:40:34.708 --> 00:40:36.228
For us, it's also very memorable.

481
00:40:36.248 --> 00:40:51.582
So I've also been filming a show called to different places in Taiwan to see how Hong Kong can integrate into the development of our country,

482
00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:55.498
and what contributions we can make.

483
00:40:55.518 --> 00:41:03.882
On the other hand, we can also let Hong Kong people know that after returning to our motherland, our motherland has developed so well that there are many opportunities for us Hong Kongers.

484
00:41:11.721 --> 00:41:17.949
So I think it's very interesting for us to be able to communicate more and let everyone know more about it.

485
00:41:18.088 --> 00:41:19.451
I really want to do more.

486
00:41:25.148 --> 00:41:27.248
We are also looking forward to your new show.

487
00:41:27.268 --> 00:41:29.391
Thank you for sharing with us.

488
00:41:29.411 --> 00:41:30.952
